Name That Tune
============

A hack day, or rather weekend I did recently. 

Its messy but has some nice little features some people may find useful and want to start their own projects off. 

##FEATURES

1. Cool avatar creator which allows you to take a picture of yourself with your web cam and upload it to the server.
2. Chat Room.
3. Sound Cloud Integration. (simple add the sound cloud ID to the questions collection in game.js).
4. Arbitrary animated gifs to make people laugh. 


I will continue to add to this overtime just for fun, which basically means the code is in a state at the moment. 

Buy hey, thats what hack days are for!
